# CLI-Dice-Roller
This is just a simple CLI dice rolling program I wrote. I play D&D with friends and rolling large numbers of dice is always annoying. I have tried several dice rolling apps or websites, but they are usually slow (because they animate the actual dice rolling) and/or don't show you the individual die results as well as the total, just one or the other. Also a lot of them are web apps and require internet connection. I built this to be fast, simple, and clear.

## Usage
This can take either 2 arguments, the first being the number of dice to roll and the second, the number of sides each die should have, or no arguments and it will ask for each of those values individually.
